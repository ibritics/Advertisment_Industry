## 7 Questions <br>
1. Relationship between advertising sales and budget: <br>
A multiple regression model was used to test the hypothesis of no relationship.
The low p-value from the F-statistic indicated clear evidence of a relationship between advertising and sales.
2. Strength of the relationship:<br>
Two measures of model accuracy were discussed.
The RSE (Residual Standard Error) was 1,681 units, indicating a percentage error of roughly 12%.
The R2 statistic showed that the predictors explained almost 90% of the variance in sales.
3. Contribution of different media to sales:<br>
Examining the p-values of each predictor's t-statistic indicated the contribution of each medium.
TV and radio had low p-values, suggesting a significant relationship with sales.
The p-value for newspaper was not significant, indicating it was not related to sales.
4. Effect of each medium on sales:<br>
Confidence intervals for the regression coefficients (Î²) were provided.
TV and radio had narrow intervals, far from zero, indicating a significant effect on sales.
The interval for newspaper included zero, suggesting it was not statistically significant.
5. Accuracy of future sales prediction:<br>
Prediction intervals for individual responses and confidence intervals for average responses were discussed.
Prediction intervals were wider than confidence intervals to account for the uncertainty in the irreducible error.
6. Linearity of the relationship:<br>
Residual plots were used to identify non-linearity.
The Advertising data showed a non-linear effect.
Transformations of predictors were discussed to accommodate non-linear relationships.
7. Synergy among advertising media: <br>
The standard linear regression model assumes an additive relationship.
An interaction term can be included to account for non-additive relationships.
The Advertising data suggested non-additivity, and including the interaction term increased the R2 from 90% to almost 97%.
